# MetaX
High-Performance Object Storage

## Overview
This repository is for temporarily placing the Cheetah/MetaX project before publication. 
We design a novel MetaX structure that contains all meta information 
(i.e., meta-data and meta-log) for an ongoing object put request. 
Based on MetaX we design Cheetah, a directory-based object store 
that achieves high object I/O performance without affecting migration-free expandability.

Note: The key components of Cheetah/MetaX are temporarily not available until the paper is accepted, 
for hiding author info so as to satisfy the anonymity requirement.
